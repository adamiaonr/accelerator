For Linux users: on the directory holding the .tex files run 'make'.
For others (we know who you are...): open the .tex files in your 'fancy' GUIs.

There may be problems due to lack of some of the packages added in the 
preamble.tex file: 
	* Quick-fix: comment the lines which are giving you problems (e.g. add 
		a '%' to the start of a line like '\usepackage{cprotect}')
	* Long-fix: install the package!

The main latex file is acceleraTor.tex: each section has its dedicated file (this 
may not be 'that' appropriate for a small doc like this proposal, but this is the 
usual structure I follow in larger docs like reports and papers, so I just used 
it here too [adamiaonr]). 

The .bib file is huge (2.7 MB)! This is because I simply symlinked my complete 
bibliography to this latex doc (as I always do now) instead of creating a special 
.bib file for it. Feel free to erase what it doesn't matter...
