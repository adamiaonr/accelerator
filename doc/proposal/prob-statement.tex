\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:prob-statement}

Tor~\cite{Dingledine:2004:TSO:1251375.1251396} is the most prominent and widely used low-latency anonymous network. A random path consisting of multiple relay nodes (ORs) is chosen by the source and packets are encrypted in layers using the private key of each OR on the path. On the reception of packets,  ORs decrypt them using their public key and forward the remaining packet to next OR or the destination. Unlike mix networks, Tor does not perform any explicit delaying and reordering of packets, and instead relies on the  generation of sufficient traffic in the network to avoid traffic analysis. 

However, there are two problems that Tor faces: 1) lack of explicit mixing makes Tor vulnerable to side channel attacks; e.g. Murdoch and Danezis~\cite{Murdoch:2005:LTA:1058433.1059390}, and 2) the packet delay is still large to support faster applications, such as VoIP and web chat. We aim to develop a faster version of Tor by making use of the new packet processing framework DPDK that has been able to substantially reduce packet processing times. We propose to use DPDK to implement Tor client and OR functionalities and reduce their processing time. Our success will allow Tor to introduce explicit mixing and enhance anonymity for sensitive applications, and also support other relevant application such as VoIP.
