In this section we list the outcomes expected upon completion of the project 
and milestones (...).

\textbf{Outcomes:}

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item A modified version of Tor OP\slash OR software - the AcceleraTOR 
	system - well integrated with DPDK libraries and possibly incorporating 
	recently proposed techniques for latency reduction in Tor (e.g. 
	uTor~\cite{179191}, etc.)
	
	\item A latency reduction of x\% (x $> 0$) while performing different sets 
	of operations \slash running different applications over Tor (e.g. download 
	of web content, live video streaming, etc.)
	
	\item Qualitative understanding and/or quantitative results (perhaps graphs) of the 
	latency-anonymity tradeoffs present in the clockWatcher system
	
	\item Comparison of AcceleraTOR to related work 
	
	\item At least a final report \& poster combo! Maybe a paper (equivalent of a workshop version).

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Milestones:}

\begin{itemize}

	\item (\textit{End of Feb}) Software specification for the AcceleraTOR system: 

	\begin{itemize}

		\item Coupling between Tor and DPDK libs - find the place for optimal 
		integration

		\item Integration of recently proposed latency-reduction techniques in 
		the AcceleraTOR system
		
		\item Design and Integration of latency-reduction techniques devised 
		by ourselves

	\end{itemize}

	\item (\textit{End of Feb}) Specifications for testbed:

	\begin{itemize}

		\item Structure of the testbed network (e.g. how many nodes, topologies, etc.)

		\item Network virtualization tools to use, how to use them, etc.

		\item Selection of DPDK-supported NICs to use in OP\slash OR nodes

	\end{itemize}

	\item (\textit{mid to end March}) Software implementation finished
	\item (\textit{mid to end March}) Testbed setup `ready to roll' and run initial release of 
		AcceleraTOR 
	\item (\textit{mid March to early April}) Test, collect data, solve problems in 
		implementation, re-test, re-collect data
	\item (\textit{rest of April}) Write report, make a poster, and polish presentation 

\end{itemize}
