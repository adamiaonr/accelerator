abstract = {The dynamic classification and identification of network applications responsible for network traffic flows offers substantial benefits to a number of key areas in IP network engineering, management and surveillance. Currently such classifications rely on selected packet header fields (e.g. port numbers) or application layer protocol decoding. These methods have a number of shortfalls e.g. many applications can use unpredictable port numbers and protocol decoding requires a high amount of computing resources or is simply infeasible in case protocols are unknown or encrypted. We propose a novel method for traffic classification and application identification using an unsupervised machine learning technique. Flows are automatically classified based on statistical flow characteristics. We evaluate the efficiency of our approach using data from several traffic traces collected at different locations of the Internet. We use feature selection to find an optimal feature set and determine the influence of different features},

abstract = {Attempts to generalize the Internet's point-to-point communication abstraction to provide services like multicast, anycast, and mobility have faced challenging technical problems and deployment barriers. To ease the deployment of such services, this paper proposes an overlay-based Internet Indirection Infrastructure I3) that offers a rendezvous-based communication abstraction. Instead of explicitly sending a packet to a destination, each packet is associated with an identifier; this identifier is then used by the receiver to obtain delivery of the packet. This level of indirection decouples the act of sending from the act of receiving, and allows I3 to efficiently support a wide variety of fundamental communication services. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we have designed and built a prototype based on the Chord lookup protocol.},

abstract = {The information-centric networking (ICN) concept is a significant common approach of several future Internet research activities. The approach leverages in-network caching, multiparty communication through replication, and interaction models decoupling senders and receivers. The goal is to provide a network infrastructure service that is better suited to todays use (in particular. content distribution and mobility) and more resilient to disruptions and failures. The ICN approach is being explored by a number of research projects. We compare and discuss design choices and features of proposed ICN architectures, focusing on the following main components: named data objects, naming and security, API, routing and transport, and caching. We also discuss the advantages of the ICN approach in general.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous in-network caching is one of the key aspects of information-centric networking (ICN) which has recently received widespread research interest. In one of the key relevant proposals known as Networking Named Content (NNC), the premise is that leveraging in-network caching to store content in every node it traverses along the delivery path can enhance content delivery. We question such indiscriminate universal caching strategy and investigate whether caching less can actually achieve more. Specifically, we investigate if caching only in a subset of node(s) along the content delivery path can achieve better performance in terms of cache and server hit rates. In this paper, we first study the behavior of NNCs ubiquitous caching and observe that even na\"{\i}ve random caching at one intermediate node within the delivery path can achieve similar and, under certain conditions, even better caching gain. We propose a centrality-based caching algorithm by exploiting the concept of (ego network) betweenness centrality to improve the caching gain and eliminate the uncertainty in the performance of the simplistic random caching strategy. Our results suggest that our solution can consistently achieve better gain across both synthetic and real network topologies that have different structural properties.},

abstract = {In its 5th decade, the Internet's future evolution is hampered by the increasing complexity and sophistication of the processes managing its infrastructure. Management costs require a technically skilled human intellect, amounting to a substantial part of total cost of ownership. Self-management is positioned as a key capacity towards a scalable future Internet architecture. Herein we present key technological enablers for self-manageable future Internet systems, namely monitoring, decision-making and machine learning. We survey the state-of-the-art in network management aspects of these thematic areas and present a use case where their synergetic capacities render solutions to a known transport problem in wireless settings. Finally, we conclude the paper with a discussion of important issues for these technological enablers in the context of future Internet.},

@inproceedings{Tsilopoulos2011,
abstract = {In this paper we focus on the issue of transferring diverse kinds of information through information-centric networks (ICNs). We argue that the one request per packet mode of operation suggested in the early development of ICN applications is not a good fit for some types of traffic, such as media streams and real-time notifications. To efficiently deliver all kinds of information, we argue that an ICN should not only identify information by its name, it should also be aware of the nature of its traffic. We classify information traffic types based on two characteristics: a) reliable vs. unreliable transfer and b) real-time vs. on-demand delivery. The combination of these two characteristics leads to three broad categories: a) channels, b) on-demand documents and c) real-time documents. To handle all traffic types, we propose two extensions to the CCN architecture: Persistent Interests and Reliable Notifications. We describe how these additions, together with a careful selection of information names, can efficiently support these three categories of information traffic types. \&copy; 2011 ACM.},

abstract = {The Internet has evolved greatly from its original incarnation. For instance, the vast majority of current Internet usage is data retrieval and service access, whereas the architecture was designed around host-to-host applications such as telnet and ftp. Moreover, the original Internet was a purely transparent carrier of packets, but now the various network stakeholders use middleboxes to improve security and accelerate applications. To adapt to these changes, we propose the Data-Oriented Network Architecture (DONA), which involves a clean-slate redesign of Internet naming and name resolution.},

abstract = {The ongoing demographic changes in the European population are consistently stressing healthcare systems with an increasing number of elderly and chronically ill patients. In order to reach an economically and socially viable solution, home healthcare monitoring systems have been exploited. In this paper, we present the eCAALYX project, a manageable, expandable, inter-operable and low-cost Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) solution. Specifically we focus on the Home Gateway component. The eCAALYX Home Gateway relies in the use of open standardized protocols, as well as a modular architecture in order to create an unifying layer between sensors from several manufacturers and different caretaker entities. The performance analysis of our Home Gateway implementation indicates that such a system can run reliably on currently available off-the-shelf equipment, suggesting the practicability of a real-world deployment.},

abstract = {Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a novel networking paradigm centered around content distribution rather than host-to-host connectivity. This change from host-centric to content-centric has several attractive advantages, such as network load reduction, low dissemination latency, and energy efficiency. However, it is unclear whether today's technology is ready for the CCN (r)evolution. The major contribution of this paper is a systematic evaluation of the suitability of existing software and hardware components in today's routers for the support of CCN. Our main conclusion is that a CCN deployment is feasible at a Content Distribution Network (CDN) and ISP scale, whereas today's technology is not yet ready to support an Internet scale deployment.},

abstract = {This paper describes the Q-routing algorithm for packet routing, in which a reinforcement learning module is embedded into each node of a switching network. Only local communication is used by each node to keep accurate statistics on which routing decisions lead to minimal delivery times. In simple experiments involving a 36-node, irregularly connected network, Q-routing proves superior to a nonadaptive algorithm based on precomputed shortest paths and is able to route efficiently even when...},

Despite the volumi- nous literature, surprisingly little clarity is emerging as most papers focus on what differentiates them from other proposals. We begin this paper by identifying the existing commonalities and important differences in these designs, and then discuss some remaining research issues. After our review, we emerge skeptical (but open-minded) about the value of this approach to networking.},

@article{Kulkarni2011,
abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are networks of distributed autonomous devices that can sense or monitor physical or environmental conditions cooperatively. WSNs face many challenges, mainly caused by communication failures, storage and computational constraints and limited power supply. Paradigms of computational intelligence (CI) have been successfully used in recent years to address various challenges such as data aggregation and fusion, energy aware routing, task scheduling, security, optimal deployment and localization. CI provides adaptive mechanisms that exhibit intelligent behavior in complex and dynamic environments like WSNs. CI brings about flexibility, autonomous behavior, and robustness against topology changes, communication failures and scenario changes. However, WSN developers are usually not or not completely aware of the potential CI algorithms offer. On the other side, CI researchers are not familiar with all real problems and subtle requirements of WSNs. This mismatch makes collaboration and development difficult. This paper intends to close this gap and foster collaboration by offering a detailed introduction to WSNs and their properties. An extensive survey of CI applications to various problems in WSNs from various research areas and publication venues is presented in the paper. Besides, a discussion on advantages and disadvantages of CI algorithms over traditional WSN solutions is offered. In addition, a general evaluation of CI algorithms is presented, which will serve as a guide for using CI algorithms for WSNs.},

abstract = {Although semi-supervised learning has been an active area of research, its use in deployed applications is still relatively rare because the methods are often difficult to implement, fragile in tuning, or lacking in scalability. This paper presents expectation regularization, a semi-supervised learning method for exponential family parametric models that augments the traditional conditional label-likelihood objective function with an additional term that encourages model predictions on unlabeled data to match certain expectations---such as label priors. The method is extremely easy to implement, scales as well as logistic regression, and can handle non-independent features. We present experiments on five different data sets, showing accuracy improvements over other semi-supervised methods.},

@article{Jacobson2009,
abstract = {Network use has evolved to be dominated by content distribution and retrieval, while networking technology still speaks only of connections between hosts. Accessing content and services requires mapping from the what that users care about to the network's where. We present Content-Centric Networking (CCN) which treats content as a primitive - decoupling location from identity, security and access, and retrieving content by name. Using new approaches to routing named content, derived heavily from IP, we can simultaneously achieve scalability, security and performance. We implemented our architecture's basic features and demonstrate resilience and performance with secure file downloads and VoIP calls.},

abstract = {The research community has begun looking for IP traffic classification techniques that do not rely on `well known TCP or UDP port numbers, or interpreting the contents of packet payloads. New work is emerging on the use of statistical traffic characteristics to assist in the identification and classification process. This survey paper looks at emerging research into the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to IP traffic classification - an inter-disciplinary blend of IP networking and data mining techniques. We provide context and motivation for the application of ML techniques to IP traffic classification, and review 18 significant works that cover the dominant period from 2004 to early 2007. These works are categorized and reviewed according to their choice of ML strategies and primary contributions to the literature. We also discuss a number of key requirements for the employment of ML-based traffic classifiers in operational IP networks, and qualitatively critique the extent to which the reviewed works meet these requirements. Open issues and challenges in the field are also discussed.},
